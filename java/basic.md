  <summary>Answer here</summary>
  Java internally takes care of unused declaration of hanging object declaration. So it’s called as robust programming language. It will have time check for each variable declarations to clear the garbage frequently/periodically. JDK allows to change the garbage collector algorithms. The heap memory will be cleared by performing garbage action. Global declarations with Singleton scope cannot be cleared by garbage collector. So setting the global declaration to null will help the application to be safe with memory management.
